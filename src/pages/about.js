      <p>
        I'm David Melnychuk, a fourth-year computing science student at SFU and
        avid learner.

      <p>
        This website is a place for me to document everything I learn through
        life. I wanted to create a record of the things I've learned and done so
        I can better reflect on my past and measure my progress.
