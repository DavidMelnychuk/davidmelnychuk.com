      <p>
        I'm David Melnychuk, a fourth-year computing science student at SFU and
        an avid learner.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is a place for me to write and document everything I learn. I wanted to create a record of the things I've learned so
        I can better reflect on my past and measure my progress.
