Thinking is important, but action is what drives progress. If you're anything like me then you overthink and overanalyze things. You read and gather as much information as possible and wait for the moment when you feel confident enough to start something. Well, that perfect moment never comes and it never will. The best way to learn and achieve is to dive head-first and learn as you go.

Throw out perfectionism. Allow yourself to suck and make mistakes. When you first start something, you're not going to be good, and that's okay. Just keep trying, keep creating, keep doing whatever it is you do and eventually you will improve. Along the way you'll learn and run into problems that you could have never imagined if all you did was sit and ponder. Overcome those challenges, reflect, and then do it all again tomorrow.
