I always thought it would be cool to see Jeff Bezos package and ship the first Amazon products from his garage. To watch Bill Gates program the first versions of Microsoft. To get a raw, unfiltered look into their lives and see how they got to where they are today. I'm not saying I'm like them, just that I'm curious about how people actually spend their time and the processes involved in getting to where they are today.

This site is mainly for myself. A written document of everything I'm working on and learning. I'm making it public for two reasons. One, I'll have a written history that I can read and reminisce over when I'm older, and maybe someone online will find it interesting as well. Two, by recording what I'm doing and learning publicly, it helps keep me motivated and accountable, even if nobody reads it. The mere act of publicly documenting what I'm doing makes me want to work harder and keep improving.

Beyond documenting what I do, I want to write articles about the things I've learned. Summarizing, synthesizing, and explaining what I've learned will help solidify my knowledge and hopefully be useful to someone else as well. I'll occasionally write about whatever's on my mind to help myself think more clearly and develop my ideas.

Thanks for reading,

David
