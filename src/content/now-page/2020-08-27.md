## Primary Focus

- Reviewing full stack MERN fundamentals by working through [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en)

- Trying to get better at competitive programming and algorithmic thinking. Right now, mostly doing practice problems from [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/). Trying to enter contests whenever I have the time.

## Courses I'm taking

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en)
  A course that teaches modern full stack development with the MERN stack.

- [The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
  A short course from MIT that teaches tools commonly used in programming such as the shell, bash scripts, vim, etc.

## Books I'm Reading

- [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup)

- [The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money)

- [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)

## Exercises I'm doing

- Since the lockdown started, I've just been trying to maintain the habit of walking everyday and running roughly twice a week. Hoping to get back to the gym soon when things settle down a bit. I miss lifting.

## Experiments I'm trying

- This website. We'll see how long I'll keep it up for. A few days in and I've noticed that trying to document EVERYTHING I learn is actually quite difficult and time consuming. I'll try to focus more on the bigger things that I learn and less on the small tidbits or facts that I pick up day to day.

- Trying to meditate everyday. I've meditated daily in the past but the habit didn't stick. Sometimes it's a struggle, but I swear it makes me feel calmer and more clear-minded afterwards. There's probably other benefits that I don't notice or directly attribute to meditation.
