## Primary Focus

- Learning as much as I can to excel in my job as a full stack developer.

## Books I'm Reading

- [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup)

- [The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money)

- [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)

## Experiments I'm trying

- This website. We'll see how long I'll keep it up for. A few days in and I've noticed that trying to document EVERYTHING I learn is actually quite difficult and time consuming. I'll try to focus more on the bigger things that I learn and less on the small tidbits or facts that I pick up day to day.

- Journaling consistently. I find reflecting on the day and planning for tomorrow helps bring mental clarity and focus to my life.
