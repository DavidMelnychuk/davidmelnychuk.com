- Finished developing this website. It's not exactly how I want it to be, but it's good enough for now. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. I'll probably tweak and iteratively update it in the future; definitely need to do some refactoring.

- Deployed website to [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- Setup custom email with [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/).

- Learned about the [Flynn Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect): IQ test scores have been consistently increasing all across the world throughout the 20th century. Learned from the book [Range](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range). -->
