#### üë®‚Äçüíª &nbsp;Worked on:

- Developing and deploying this website
- Updating my resume
- Cleaning up and mirroring repos to GitHub from GitLab
- Watching [Missing Semester lectures](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

#### üí° &nbsp;Learned

- How to deploy static sites with [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

- How to set up custom emails with [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/)

- How to [mirror git repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html).

- About the [Flynn Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect): IQ test scores have been consistently increasing all across the world throughout the 20th century. Learned from the book [Range](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range).

- About [bounce rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate): percentage of users who enter a site and leave after viewing only one page.

- Why "typeof null" returns object in JavaScript: [The history of "typeof null"](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html). This bug can't be fixed because it would break too many existing websites.

- The mental model of viewing variables as wires from Dan Abramov's [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/). Variables always point to values, and cannot point to each other. Remember that JavaScript primitive values are immutable and that we pass by value to functions.

- About data wrangling, regular expressions, job control, dotfiles, tmux, and working with remote servers from Lecture [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_dsktIjt4) and [5](https://youtu.be/e8BO_dYxk5c) of [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

- About [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker): a tool that fetches a git repository and builds a container image based on the configuration files found in the repo.

- To write these learning journals weekly rather than daily.
