COMMENTED OUT TO KEEP AS ARCHIVE AND SHOW HOW I ITERATED ON THIS IDEA.

- Learned how to [mirror git repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html).

- Learned about [bounce rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate): percentage of users who enter a site and leave after viewing only one page.

- Learned why "typeof null" returns object in JavaScript: [The history of "typeof null"](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html). This bug can't be fixed because it would break too many existing websites.

- Learned the mental model of viewing variables as wires from Dan Abramov's [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/). Variables always point to values, and cannot point to each other. Remember that JavaScript primitive values are immutable and that we pass by value to functions.

- Learned more about data wrangling, regular expressions, job control, dotfiles, tmux, and working with remote servers from Lecture [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_dsktIjt4) and [5](https://youtu.be/e8BO_dYxk5c) of [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

- Realized if I'm learning from information dense resources like courses, then it's probably not best to note everything within this work journal. Will probably use this journal strictly for logging work and high-level learning summarizations going forward. Will experiment with instead attaching a link to detailed notes and learnings at the end of each week. -->
